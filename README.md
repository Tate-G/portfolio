I construct neural network models to predict delayed US flights 1-2 months in advance. Model evaluation shows significantly improved delay predictions compared to rudimentary baseline models. Delay predictions are adjustable for varied applications that may require high precision or high recall. A thorough examination of model feature importance also reveals specific predictor variables contributing to higher or lower delay probability.

## Race and Internet in TN

I utilize a multivariable polynomial regression and US Census data to examine relationships between broadband internet access and race and ethnicity in Tennessee. Race and ethnicity are statistically significant predictors of broadband internet access, beyond what can be predicted from economics and population density alone. I utilize geopandas to examine select spatial trends in TN, and I utilize regression modeling to identify specific racial and ethnic groups less likely to have household broadband internet.
